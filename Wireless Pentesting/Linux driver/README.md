# RTL88x2BU Wireless Driver Setup Scripts

This repository contains two scripts that automate the process of setting up the RTL88x2BU wireless driver on Linux systems using DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support).

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK** ⚠️

This script is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. By using this script, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

1. This script modifies system files and installs kernel modules. Incorrect use or unforeseen issues could potentially cause system instability or other problems.
2. The authors and contributors of this script are not responsible for any damage, data loss, or other issues that may occur as a result of using this script.
3. This script is designed for use with specific hardware (RTL88x2BU chipset wireless adapters) and may not work with other hardware.
4. Always backup important data before running scripts that modify system configurations.
5. This script requires root privileges. Be sure you trust the source and have reviewed the script before running it with elevated permissions.
6. Make sure to cross-verify the GitHub repo that is being cloned in the script

## Scripts

1. `install_cilynx_driver.sh`: Installs the driver from [cilynx/rtl88x2bu](https://github.com/cilynx/rtl88x2bu)
2. `install_rincat_driver.sh`: Installs the driver from [RinCat/RTL88x2BU-Linux-Driver](https://github.com/RinCat/RTL88x2BU-Linux-Driver)

## Key Differences

While both scripts aim to install RTL88x2BU drivers, they have some differences:

1. **Source Repository**: 
   - Cilynx script clones from: https://github.com/cilynx/rtl88x2bu
   - RinCat script clones from: https://github.com/RinCat/RTL88x2BU-Linux-Driver

2. **Dependencies**: 
   - The RinCat script explicitly installs `build-essential` in addition to other dependencies.

3. **Driver Conflicts**: 
   - The RinCat script includes steps to blacklist conflicting drivers (specifically `rtw88_8822bu`) and update initramfs.

4. **Version Extraction**: 
   - Minor differences in how they extract the driver version from dkms.conf.

## How They Work

Both scripts perform the following general steps:

1. Check and install necessary dependencies.
2. Install the appropriate kernel headers.
3. Clone the respective RTL88x2BU driver repository from GitHub.
4. Extract the driver version from the repository.
5. Copy the driver source to the appropriate DKMS directory.
6. Add, build, and install the driver using DKMS.
7. Load the new driver module into the kernel.
8. Ask to reboot the system.

The RinCat script additionally:
9. Blacklists potentially conflicting drivers.
10. Updates initramfs.

## Which Script to Use?

- Try the RinCat script (`install_rincat_driver.sh`) first, as it includes additional steps to handle driver conflicts.
- If you encounter issues with the RinCat driver, you can try the cilynx script (`install_cilynx_driver.sh`) as an alternative.
- You may need to experiment to find which works best for your specific hardware and system configuration.

- **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of both repositories with your specific Linux kernel version. Older kernels might require additional steps or might not be fully supported.

- **Backup:** Before making any changes to your system, it's always a good practice to create a backup of your important data.

- **Read Documentation:** Carefully read the README files and any additional documentation provided by both repositories to understand the specific installation instructions and potential limitations.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone
   ```
2. Navigate to the script directory:
   ```
   cd
   ```
3. Make the scripts executable:
   ```
   chmod +x install_cilynx_driver.sh install_rincat_driver.sh
   ```
4. Run the script of your choice with sudo:
   ```
   sudo ./install_cilynx_driver.sh
   ```
   or
   ```
   sudo ./install_rincat_driver.sh
   ```

## FAQ

Q: Will this script work for any wireless adapter?
A: No, this script is specifically designed for wireless adapters using the RTL88x2BU chipset. It may not work with other chipsets.

Q: Do I need to run this script every time I boot my computer?
A: No, once installed successfully, the driver should persist across reboots. You only need to run the script once, or when updating the driver.

Q: The script ran successfully, but I still don't see a wireless interface. Why?
A: Ensure that you have a compatible wireless adapter physically connected to your system. If you're running this in a virtual machine, you need to enable "USB controller" settings for your VM and add your particular adapter to it using "+" symbol.

Q: Can I use this script on any Linux distribution?
A: This script is designed for Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu). It may need modifications for other distributions that use different package managers or have different system configurations.

Q: The script failed to compile the driver. What should I do?
A: Ensure your system is up to date, you have the correct kernel headers installed, and your wireless adapter is compatible. If issues persist, check the driver's GitHub repository for known issues or open a new issue there.

Q: Is it safe to remove the cloned repository after installation?
A: Yes, once the driver is successfully installed via DKMS, you can safely remove the cloned repository.

Q: Do I need to reboot after running the script?
A: While not always necessary, rebooting is recommended to ensure all changes take effect properly. The script will offer to reboot at the end.
